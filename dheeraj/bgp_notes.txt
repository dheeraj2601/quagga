peer-group
----------

A peer-group is a set of BGP neighbors that shares the same outbound policy, where the inbound policies might be different.

BGP peer groups are used to simplify configuration and to improve performance. It can be used when a router has a group of neighbors with the same update policies. The update is generated once per group rather than for each neighbor.


When advertising updates, the routing table is inspected ONLY ONE TIME, sent to one peer-group member and then duplicated to all other members .
